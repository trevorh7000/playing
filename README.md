testing repot for repo creatinon on command line
This ius added from the githib website to test me syncing down to my pc with vs code
I willalso test my command line skills

Ok this showed up in my local repo only after I used the command line
git pull origin master
 now I will see if vscode can handle the up loading of this change

 Trev Out

ok now this came up and this line added in github again but trying to ssee if vs code can grab this cange by istefl

ok that worked grand - offere me to sync so I did and it poulled this in
Still unsure whare all the version istiry is - as that is what I woudl lile to see - go back a couple of commits to get code that i had deleted out of my python file
 or this readme - how do I get the original and all other copies fo this file - thats up next
